contact.sunesisMeaning=Sunesis name was not chosen randomly, but communicates the core values represented by the company.<br/><br/> The Greeks had three great words describing three great qualities of the mind. If a man possessed these three qualities he had a mind equipped. The words are: <br/> Sophia (wisdom of ultimate things),<br/> Phronesis (prudence) and<br/> <b>Sunesis</b>,<br/> which literally means uniting, bringing together, integrating. It would be true to say that Sunesis is that faculty of putting two and two together. In its essence Sunesis is the power to asses, distinguish, criticize and evaluate, understand and to form judgments.
